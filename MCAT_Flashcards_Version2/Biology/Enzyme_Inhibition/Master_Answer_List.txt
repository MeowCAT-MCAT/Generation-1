As an enzyme is a protein, it may denature at a suboptimal temperature or pH.
Inhibitors disrupt the enzyme's active site.
With the addition of more substrate.
Compete with substrate for an enzyme's active site.
Non-Competetive Inhibitors alter an enzyme by binding to a portion of it other than the active site, such that the substrate can no longer "fit" in the active site, preventing (Vmax).
