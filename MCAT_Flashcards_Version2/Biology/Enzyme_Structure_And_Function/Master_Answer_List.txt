As enzymes are highly selective catalysts, they remain unchanged at the end of a biochemical reaction.
Enzymes provide an alternative energy pathway.
Enzymes only alter the rate of reaction, not the position of equilibrium.
An Enzyme Cofactor is a non-protein addition to an enzyme.
The addition of more substrates won't increase the reaction rate if all active sites are bound, as they are in a rate-limited reaction.
The enzyme-substrate-complex changes shape to facilitate reactions.
The rate of the reaction is proportional to the enzyme concentration.
The enzyme's active site specifically binds to substrate.
